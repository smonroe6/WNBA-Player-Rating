# 🏀 WNBA Player Rating System

![License: MIT](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-yellow.svg)

This project creates a custom WNBA player evaluation system inspired by ESPN's NBA Player Efficiency Rating (PER). It calculates and compares four performance metrics — **Efficiency**, **Win Score**, a NBA **PER rating**, and a custom weighted **WNBA PER** — using publicly available WNBA season totals.

## 📌 Project Purpose

- Evaluate WNBA player performance using multiple rating formulas
- Normalize for playing time and team changes
- Provide a transparent, reproducible workflow for analysis

## 📈 Metrics Explained

All metrics are computed per game (or per minute for PER), and adjusted to remove duplicate entries for multi-team players.

### 🔹 1. Efficiency

A basic per-game productivity measure:

Efficiency = (PTS + TRB + AST + STL - TOV - (FGA - FG) - (FTA - FT)) / G

### 🔹 2. Win Score

A weighted version of box score stats:

WinScore = (PTS + TRB + STL + 0.5 × AST + 0.5 × BLK - FGA - TOV - 0.5 × FTA - 0.5 × PF) / G

### 🔹 3. NBA PER

A minute-adjusted composite score using weighted coefficients:

PER = 0.68 + (1 / MP) × [ 26.77 × FG - 35.58 × FGA + 26.32 × FT - 25.47 × FTA + 42.74 × ORB + 11.45 × DRB + 29.70 × AST + 47.30 × STL + 38.00 × BLK - 47.90 × TOV - 18.80 × PF + 41.10 × PTS]

These weights are loosely modeled after NBA PER logic

### 🔹 4. Custom WNBA PER

A minute-adjusted composite score using weighted coefficients:

PER = 0.3289 + (1 / MP) × [ 53.35 × FG - 29.28 × FGA + 15.27 × FT - 25.34 × FTA + 47.72 × ORB + 10.95 × DRB + 31.61 × AST + 50.72 × STL + 50.68 × BLK - 45.88 × TOV - 61.23 × PF + 41.10 × PTS]

See how these were computed on my site [here](R/NBAVsWNBA.html)

## 🚀 How to Run

### 1. Clone the repo

git clone https://github.com/smonroe6/WNBA-Player-Rating.git  
cd WNBA-Player-Rating

### 2. Install dependencies

Only pandas is required:  
pip install pandas

### 3. Run the notebooks

notebooks/scrape.ipynb → Fetches and saves raw season totals

notebooks/Metrics.ipynb → Cleans data, calculates all three metrics, and saves to CSV

## ✅ Future Enhancements

Add per-possession and pace-adjusted stats

Visualize trends with Tableau or Streamlit

Create player dashboards and career summaries

Automate scraping for real-time updates during the season
