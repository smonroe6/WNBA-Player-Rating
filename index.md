# 🏀 WNBA Player Rating System

Welcome to my custom WNBA analytics project!  
This site showcases a player evaluation system inspired by ESPN's Player Efficiency Rating (PER), adapted specifically for the WNBA using publicly available season data.

---

## 📌 Project Goals

- Evaluate WNBA player performance using custom metrics  
- Normalize performance across playing time and team changes  
- Make the analysis transparent and reproducible  

---

## 📊 Metrics Used

### Efficiency
A basic box score formula measuring productivity per game.

### Win Score
A weighted version of box stats accounting for value-added and cost.

### Custom PER
A PER-style composite using WNBA-specific stat weights and minutes played.
