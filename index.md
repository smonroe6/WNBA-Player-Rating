# 🏀 WNBA Player Rating System

Welcome to my custom WNBA analytics project!  
This site showcases a player evaluation system inspired by ESPN's Player Efficiency Rating (PER), adapted specifically for the WNBA using publicly available season data.

---

## 📌 Project Goals

- Evaluate WNBA player performance using custom metrics
- Normalize performance across playing time and team changes
- Make the analysis transparent and reproducible

---

## 📊 Metrics Used

### Efficiency

A basic box score formula measuring productivity per game.

### Win Score

A weighted version of box stats accounting for value-added and cost.

### NBA PER

A PER-style composite using NBA stat weights and minutes played.

### Custom PER

A PER-style composite using WNBA-specific stat weights and minutes played. How these are calculated can be found [here](https://smonroe6.github.io/WNBA-Player-Rating/R/NBAVsWNBA.html)

You can view full explanations in the [README](https://github.com/smonroe6/WNBA-Player-Rating#-metrics-explained).
